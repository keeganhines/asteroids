asteroids
=========

Python implementation of the classic game asteroids. This was an amusing (though admittedly bizarre) side project to get better at OOP in python. This game can be played in the brower based interpreter [codeskulptor] (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user28_Al26jgqQCTnpENZ.py). This version of asteroids comes at the expense of my friend Sean (sorry man).
